# Wits and Wisdom by Kendall Johnson
##### Description:
Wits and Wisdom is an engaging trivia game that uses HTML, CSS, and JS to deliver a dynamic and interactive experience. Through the implementation of DOM, Event Listeners, and several other key tools provided from the likes of JavaScript the user is given one question at a time with several choices of answers. If the user braves the challenge and selects the correct answer they are alerted with acknowledgement of valid choice and then move onto the next question. If they are wrong, they are alerted as such and then pushed to the next question, hopefully this time one they know the answer to. (MORE TO BE ADDED AND UPDATED AS THE GAME PROGRESSES IN DEVELOPMENT).
