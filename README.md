# Wits and Wisdom by Kendall Johnson
### Description:
Wits and Wisdom is an engaging trivia game that uses HTML, CSS, and JS to deliver a dynamic and interactive experience. Through the implementation of DOM, Event Listeners, and several other key tools provided from the likes of JavaScript the user is given one question at a time with several choices of answers. If the user braves the challenge and selects the correct answer they are alerted with acknowledgement of valid choice and then move onto the next question. If they are wrong, they are alerted as such and then pushed to the next question, hopefully this time one they know the answer to. (MORE TO BE ADDED AND UPDATED AS THE GAME PROGRESSES IN DEVELOPMENT).

## :camera_flash: Visuals and Helpful Insight :
### Category Selection Page
![main page](/screenshots/startingScreen.png)
When the user opens the webpage, they are greeted by a entry screen that prompts the user to select a category. Nothing else will display until they do so. This grants the user the ability to play the game in the way in which they most desire.
### Gameplay Page
![when you play the game](/screenshots/gameplay.png)
Once the user selects a category, they are launched into the game and displayed with a randomly selected question and its accompanying possible answer choices. Along with that, as the user continues to play, the score will update whenever they get a question correct and if the user is ever completely lost and does not know what to choose for an answer they can skip the question using the implemented button.
### Win Screen Page
![when you win the game](/screenshots/winScreen.png)
When the user reaches a score of 5, they are met with a winning message, the unnecessary elements including the answer choices get blurred out and you are left with the score and a "Play Again" button to restart the game when you are ready.
### Lose Screen Page
![when you lose the game](/screenshots/loseScreen.png)
When the user gets 3 questions wrong they are met with a message alerting them they have failed and, similar to when one wins, the unnecessary elements are blurred out and you are left with a "Play Again" button to restart the game.


## :computer: Technologies Used
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- JavaScript



## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Look Forward
I have a few key changes I hope to implement in the near future to increase the functionality of the game. They are as follows: 
- [ ] Add a wider question base
- [ ] Implement a more reactive environment to different screen and display sizes
- [ ] Streamline the current code using React and other JavaScript Libraries
